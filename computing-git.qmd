## What is Git and GitHub?

::: {.callout-note}
## The Key Difference
- **Git** = A tool that tracks changes to your files (like "Track Changes" in Word, but much more powerful)
- **GitHub** = A website that stores your Git projects online and enables collaboration

## Why Use Git and GitHub?

| Without Git | With Git |
|-------------|----------|
| `report_v1.docx` | Single file with complete history |
| `report_v2_final.docx` | You can go back to any previous version |
| `report_v2_final_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx` | See exactly what changed and when |
| `report_v3_supervisor_comments.docx` | Multiple people can work together |
| 😱 Which one is the latest?! | 😊 Always know the current state |

### Benefits for Data Science

- **Reproducibility**: Track exactly how your analysis evolved
- **Collaboration**: Work with teammates without overwriting each other's work
- **Backup**: Your work is safely stored on GitHub
- **Portfolio**: Showcase your projects to future employers

## The Four Essential Commands

Think of Git like sending a package in the mail:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[1️⃣ Make Changes] --> B[2️⃣ Stage<br>git add]
    B --> C[3️⃣ Commit<br>git commit]
    C --> D[4️⃣ Push<br>git push]
    
    style A fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
    style B fill:#673AB7,color:#fff
    style C fill:#14C8E1,color:#000
    style D fill:#202329,color:#fff
```

### 1️⃣ Make Changes
Edit your files as normal in RStudio, VS Code, or any editor.

### 2️⃣ Stage (`git add`)
Select which changes you want to save. Like putting items in a box.

```bash
git add filename.qmd    # Add specific file
git add .               # Add all changed files
```

### 3️⃣ Commit (`git commit`)
Save a snapshot of your changes with a message. Like sealing the box with a label.

```bash
git commit -m "Add data visualization for Question 1"
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Write Good Commit Messages
- ❌ "stuff"
- ❌ "changes"  
- ❌ "fixed it"
- ✅ "Add bar chart showing population by county"
- ✅ "Fix error in linear regression model"
- ✅ "Complete Question 3 analysis"
:::

### 4️⃣ Push (`git push`)
Upload your commits to GitHub. Like posting the package.

```bash
git push
```

## Typical Workflow

Here's what you'll do for each assignment:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[📩 Accept assignment link] --> B[📋 Clone repository]
    B --> C[✏️ Work on your code]
    C --> D[💾 Save files]
    D --> E{More work<br>to do?}
    E -->|Yes| F[📦 git add & commit]
    F --> C
    E -->|No| G[📦 Final git add & commit]
    G --> H[🚀 git push]
    H --> I[✅ Submission complete!]
    
    style A fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
    style H fill:#202329,color:#fff
    style I fill:#64FFDA,color:#000
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **Accept the assignment** by clicking the link provided
2. **Clone the repository** to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. **Open the project** in RStudio or VS Code
4. **Work on your assignment** - edit the `.qmd` files
5. **Commit regularly** (at least 3 times per assignment):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Question 1"
   ```
6. **Push when done** (or periodically as backup):
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Getting Started: One-Time Setup

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click **Sign up**
2. Choose a professional username (you'll use this for years!)
   - ✅ `jane-smith` or `jsmith22`
   - ❌ `xXx_CodeNinja_xXx`
3. Use your university email for free student benefits

### 2. Configure Git

Tell Git who you are (run these once):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@bath.ac.uk"
```

### 3. Set Up Authentication

You need to authenticate with GitHub. The easiest method:

**Option A: GitHub CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
gh auth login
```

**Option B: SSH Key**
See [GitHub's SSH guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

---

## Using Git in VS Code

VS Code has excellent built-in Git support:

### The Source Control Panel

1. Click the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`)
2. You'll see all your changed files listed

### Stage, Commit, Push

1. **Stage**: Click the `+` next to files you want to commit
2. **Commit**: Type a message in the box and click the ✓ checkmark
3. **Push**: Click `...` menu → **Push** (or use the sync button)

### Visual Indicators

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🟢 `U` | Untracked (new file) |
| 🟡 `M` | Modified |
| 🔴 `D` | Deleted |
| 🟢 `A` | Added (staged) |

---

## Using Git in RStudio

RStudio also has built-in Git support:

### The Git Pane

Look for the "Git" tab in the top-right panel area.

### Stage, Commit, Push

1. **Stage**: Check the boxes next to files you want to commit
2. **Commit**: Click "Commit" button, write a message, click "Commit"
3. **Push**: Click the green "Push" arrow

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "I made changes but Git doesn't see them"

Make sure you've **saved your files** first! Git only tracks saved changes.

### "Permission denied" when pushing

Your authentication may have expired. Try:
```bash
gh auth login
```

### "Merge conflict"

This happens when the same line was changed in two places. Look for markers like:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

Delete the markers and keep the code you want, then commit.

### "I want to undo my last commit"

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
This undoes the commit but keeps your changes.

### "Help! I broke everything!"

Don't panic! Git keeps a complete history. Ask for help in office hours or post on the forum with:
- What you were trying to do
- The error message you see
- The output of `git status`

---

## Quick Reference Card

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Check status | `git status` |
| See recent history | `git log --oneline -5` |
| Stage all files | `git add .` |
| Stage one file | `git add filename` |
| Commit | `git commit -m "message"` |
| Push to GitHub | `git push` |
| Pull from GitHub | `git pull` |
| Clone a repository | `git clone <url>` |

## Assignment Submission Workflow

::: {.callout-important}
## Your Submission = Your GitHub Repository

When you push to GitHub, your work is submitted. Make sure to:
1. Commit with meaningful messages
2. Push before the deadline
3. Check that your files appear on GitHub
:::

### Checklist Before Deadline

- [ ] All `.qmd` files are saved
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] All work is committed (`git status` shows "nothing to commit")
- [ ] All work is pushed (`git push` shows "Everything up-to-date")
- [ ] You've verified on GitHub that your files are there
