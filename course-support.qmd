## Where to Get Help

Getting stuck is a normal part of learning data science! Here are the resources available to you:

### 1. Course Forum

Post questions about course content, assignments, or technical issues. Your classmates and teaching team will respond.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Good Forum Etiquette
- Search existing posts before creating a new one
- Use descriptive titles
- Include relevant code (formatted properly)
- Describe what you've already tried
:::

### 2. Office Hours

Drop in during office hours to get help from the teaching team.

| Who | When | Where |
|-----|------|-------|
| Instructor | TBA | TBA |
| TAs | TBA | TBA |

### 3. Lab Sessions

Labs are an excellent time to get help with hands-on coding questions.

### 4. Problem Classes

Problem classes are dedicated to working through exercises together.

## R Help Resources

### Documentation
- Use `?function_name` in R to get help
- Use `??search_term` to search documentation
- [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/)

### Cheatsheets

## Git and GitHub Help

### Quick Reference
```bash

git clone <url>

# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your message"

# Push to GitHub

## Computing Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

::: {.callout-warning}
## Package Installation Fails
Try:
1. Restart R/Python session
2. Update all packages
3. Check for typos in package name
4. Try a different CRAN mirror (R)
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Git Push/Pull Errors
Try:
1. Pull first: `git pull`
2. Check your internet connection
3. Verify you have write access to the repository
4. Ask for help with merge conflicts
:::

### Still Stuck?

If your issue persists after trying the above:

1. Post on the course forum with:
   - Your code (or GitHub repository link)
   - The exact error message
   - What you've already tried
   - Screenshots if helpful

2. Come to office hours or lab sessions for in-person help
