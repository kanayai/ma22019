## How Assignment Submission Works

In this course, you will submit all assignments through GitHub. This mirrors real-world data science workflows where version control is essential.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accept the Assignment

When an assignment is released, you'll receive a link. Click it to:
- Create your personal copy of the assignment repository
- This copy is linked to your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone to Your Computer

```bash
# Copy the repository URL from GitHub (click green "Code" button)
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/assignment-name.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd assignment-name
```

**In VS Code:**
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)
2. Type "Git: Clone"
3. Paste the repository URL
4. Choose where to save it

### Step 3: Work on Your Assignment

1. Open the `.qmd` file(s) provided
2. Read the instructions carefully
3. Write your code and answers
4. **Save frequently!**

### Step 4: Commit Regularly

::: {.callout-important}
## Commit at Least 3 Times!
We expect to see a progression of work in your commits. This helps us:
- Verify the work is yours
- Give partial credit if something breaks
- Provide better feedback
:::

After completing each major section:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Question 1 - data exploration"
```

Good commit points:
- After each question or section
- Before trying something risky
- At the end of each work session

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

**Your work is now submitted!** The state of your repository at the deadline is your submission.

## Assignment Repository Structure

Each assignment repository will contain:

```
assignment-name/
├── README.md           # Instructions overview
├── assignment.qmd      # Main file you'll edit
├── data/               # Datasets for the assignment
│   └── dataset.csv
└── .gitignore          # Files to ignore
```

## What Gets Graded?

| What We Look At | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Your `.qmd` file | Your code and written answers |
| Rendered output | Does your code run correctly? |
| Commit history | Shows progression of work |
| GitHub repository | Is everything properly pushed? |

---

## Deadlines and Late Policy

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important!
- **Deadline**: The state of your GitHub repository at the deadline time
- **Late submissions**: 10% penalty per day, up to 3 days
- **After 3 days**: No submissions accepted without prior arrangement
:::

### How to Check Your Submission

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Navigate to your assignment repository
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Your `.qmd` file is there and up to date
   - ✅ All files are committed
   - ✅ Last commit time is before the deadline

## Getting Your Own Copy Started

If you want to work on something **not** from an assignment invite link:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[Create new repository on GitHub] --> B[Clone to your computer]
    B --> C[Add your files]
    C --> D[Commit and push]
    
    style A fill:#202329,color:#fff
    style D fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
```

### Creating a New Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your repository
3. Select "Add a README file"
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Clone it to your computer

## Collaboration on Group Projects

For group projects, you'll work together in a shared repository:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    subgraph Shared Repository
        A[Main Branch]
    end
    
    subgraph Team Members
        B[Alice's Computer]
        C[Bob's Computer]
        D[Charlie's Computer]
    end
    
    A <-->|push/pull| B
    A <-->|push/pull| C
    A <-->|push/pull| D
    
    style A fill:#202329,color:#fff
    style B fill:#EC0836,color:#fff
    style C fill:#14C8E1,color:#000
    style D fill:#673AB7,color:#fff
```

### Rules for Group Work

1. **Pull before you start working**: `git pull`
2. **Communicate**: Tell teammates what you're working on
3. **Commit frequently**: Smaller commits are easier to merge
4. **Push when done**: Don't leave changes on your computer

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If two people edit the same line:

1. Git will show a conflict:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your version
   =======
   Their version
   >>>>>>> 
   ```
2. Edit the file to keep what you want
3. Remove the conflict markers
4. Commit the resolution
