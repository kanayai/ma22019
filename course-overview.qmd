## About This Course

MA22019 is a second-year course that introduces students to the foundations of data science. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on labs, and problem-solving sessions, you will develop practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

## Why Data Science?

Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. It is one of the fastest-growing fields, with applications in:

- Healthcare and medicine
- Finance and economics
- Social sciences
- Environmental science
- Business analytics
- And many more...
