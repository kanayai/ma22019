## What is the Terminal?

The **terminal** (also called command line, console, or shell) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why Learn the Terminal?
Many data science tools (Git, Quarto, Python packages) work best from the terminal. It's also much faster once you learn it!
:::

## Accessing the Terminal in VS Code

VS Code has a built-in terminal, so you don't need to use a separate application.

### Opening the Terminal

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Keyboard shortcut | Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key, usually below Escape) |
| Menu | **View → Terminal** |
| Command Palette | `Cmd+Shift+P` → type "Terminal: Create New Terminal" |

### Terminal Location

The terminal appears at the bottom of VS Code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│                    Your Code Editor                         │
│                                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TERMINAL                                            + ▼ × │
│ username@computer project-folder %  █                       │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Shell Do I Have?

| Operating System | Default Shell | Prompt Looks Like |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mac** | zsh | `username@computer folder %` |
| **Linux** | bash | `username@computer:~/folder$` |
| **Windows** | PowerShell | `PS C:\Users\name\folder>` |

::: {.callout-tip}
## Good News!
Mac and Linux use nearly identical commands (they're both Unix-based). Windows PowerShell is slightly different, but we'll show both.
:::

---

## Understanding the Prompt

The prompt tells you where you are:

**Mac Example (zsh):**
```
kai@macbook ma22019 % 
```
- `kai` = your username
- `macbook` = computer name
- `ma22019` = current folder
- `%` = ready for input

**Linux Example (bash):**
```
kai@ubuntu:~/Projects/ma22019$ 
```
- `kai@ubuntu` = username @ computer
- `~/Projects/ma22019` = current path (`~` = home)
- `$` = ready for input

**Windows Example (PowerShell):**
```
PS C:\Users\kai\Projects\ma22019>
```
- `PS` = PowerShell
- `C:\Users\kai\Projects\ma22019` = full path to current folder
- `>` = ready for input

## Essential Commands

### Navigating Folders

| Action | Mac/Linux | Windows | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| See current folder | `pwd` | `pwd` or `cd` | `pwd` → `/Users/kai/projects` |
| List files | `ls` | `dir` or `ls` | `ls` → shows all files |
| Go into folder | `cd folder` | `cd folder` | `cd labs` |
| Go up one level | `cd ..` | `cd ..` | `cd ..` → parent folder |
| Go to home | `cd ~` | `cd ~` | `cd ~` → home directory |

**Try it now:**
```bash
# See where you are
pwd

# List what's here
ls

# Go into a folder
cd labs

# Go back up
cd ..
```

### Creating and Deleting

| Action | Mac/Linux | Windows |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Create folder | `mkdir name` | `mkdir name` |
| Create file | `touch file.txt` | `New-Item file.txt` |
| Delete file | `rm file.txt` | `Remove-Item file.txt` |
| Delete folder | `rm -r folder` | `Remove-Item folder -Recurse` |

::: {.callout-warning}
## Be Careful with Delete!
The terminal doesn't have a recycle bin. Deleted files are gone forever.

## Multiple Terminals

You can have multiple terminals open at once in VS Code:

- Click the **+** button in the terminal panel
- Click the dropdown to switch between them
- Right-click a terminal tab to rename it

This is useful when you want:
- One terminal for `quarto preview` (running continuously)
- Another for Git commands

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"

This means the program isn't installed or isn't in your PATH.

| Command | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `quarto: command not found` | Install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) |
| `python: command not found` | Install Python or use `python3` |
| `git: command not found` | Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

### "Permission denied"

You might need to:
1. Check you're in the right folder
2. Make sure the file isn't open elsewhere
3. On Mac/Linux, you may need to use `sudo` (admin permissions)
4. On Windows, run VS Code as Administrator

### "I typed something wrong"

- Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel
- Press `↑` to get the last command and edit it
- Start fresh!
