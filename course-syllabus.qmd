## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to data science using the R and Python programming languages. You will learn to collect, wrangle, visualize, and analyze data, as well as build statistical models and communicate your findings effectively.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Wrangle and explore data** using modern tools in R (tidyverse) and Python (pandas, numpy)
2. **Visualize data** effectively using ggplot2 and matplotlib/seaborn
3. **Apply statistical models** for inference and prediction
4. **Communicate findings** through reproducible reports using Quarto
5. **Collaborate on data science projects** using Git and GitHub
6. **Write clean, reproducible code** following best practices

## Course Materials

### Textbooks

All textbooks are freely available online:

- [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund
- [Python for Data Analysis (3e)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney
- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin

### Computing

- **R**: We will use R via [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) or a local installation with RStudio
- **Python**: We will use Python via Jupyter notebooks or VS Code
- **Quarto**: For creating reproducible documents and presentations

## Assessment

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem Sheets | 30% | Weekly problem sets submitted via GitHub |
| Labs | 20% | Hands-on coding exercises completed during lab sessions |
| Midterm Exam | 20% | In-class examination (Week 5) |
| Final Project | 30% | Group data science project with written report and presentation |

### Submission via GitHub

All coursework submissions will be made via GitHub:

1. Accept the assignment invitation link (provided for each assignment)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or cloud environment
3. Complete the assignment in the provided template
4. Commit and push your changes before the deadline

## Academic Honesty

The University of Bath's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/student-academic-integrity-and-self-declaration/) applies to all work submitted for this course.

### Collaboration Policy

- **Problem Sheets**: You may discuss approaches with classmates, but all code and written work must be your own
- **Labs**: Collaboration is encouraged during lab sessions
- **Final Project**: Group work with clearly documented individual contributions

### Use of AI Tools

You may use AI assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) as learning aids, but:

- You must understand and be able to explain any code you submit
- AI-generated code must be acknowledged in your submission
- Exams will test your individual understanding without AI assistance
